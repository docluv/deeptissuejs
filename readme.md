# [Deeptissue.js](http://deeptissuejs.com/)

Deeptissue.js is a helper library to abstract away the differences between the MSPointer 
and WebKit Touch APIs. There are many JavaScript libraries publicly available that support 
the WebKit API and a few that help with the MSPointer API, but I reand nothing that bridged 
the gap. So I decided I would create a library to do just that.
